Knowledge is the antithesis of the darkness of ignorance. Hence she is depicted as pure white in color.

	<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Saraswati, sometimes spelled Sarasvati, is a Sanskrit fusion word of Sara  which means essence, and Sva which means one self, the fused word meaning “essence of oneself”, and Saraswati meaning “one who leads to essence of self knowledge”.

Without her there is only chaos and confusion. To realize her one must go beyond the pleasures of the senses and rejoice in the serenity of the spirit. </p>
